Overview of structure of Python support in this directory.


versions.py
    Default versions definitions, executed first before anything else is
    loaded.  Should only configure with pkg_resources.require and sys.path.
        This script is designed to be overridden on the command line.

startup.py
    Executed directly after loading versions.py

interactive_ioc.py
    Imported immediately before running the interactive Python script.  Places
    all the definitions from softioc.py in the environment before running the
    interactive shell.

softioc.py
    This defines all the imports required for an interactive IOC shell.


alarm.py
    Alarm definitions from EPICS alarm.h.

fields.py
    Defines the field level interface to fields within a record.

imports.py
    Defines DLL imports used throughout this system.

device_core.py
device.py
    Implementation of Python record support for a sensible set of records.

builder.py
    Wrapper around builder and device records: records that are automatically
    created, so no .db file ever needs to be created!
